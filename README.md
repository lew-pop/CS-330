# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software similar to solving a math problem. I write down all the knowns and try to compile a list of the unknowns. I create a skeleton outline for any classes, functions, or variables the software will need. If the software is significant with many components, I will create empty folders in a repository to visualize the system’s structure and get an idea of how it will work.
From this assignment, I’ve gained and improved many skills. The most valuable things I’ve gained from the project are improving my C++ skills, utilizing continuous integration tools, and learning graphic pipelines.


# How do I approach developing programs?

This assignment is one of the most complex assignments I have worked on. Utilizing different libraries while learning how they work was challenging. Learning about continuous integration was extremely useful because it allows you to go back to a program version before it gets over complicated. Going back to simple code versions allows me to test bits of code to see what small change breaks the code. I tend to overcomplicate things and find it best to try the most basic concepts before diving into more complex ideas.


# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Technology is rapidly being integrated into society. Classes are being taught online, and since visuals are a large part of learning, computer graphics will be more prevalent to aid virtual classrooms. Virtual graphics are incredibly beneficial for research and the advancement of humanity. It would be nice to say we live in a perfect world and solving world problems isn’t necessary. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case, and world problems do exist. Fortunately, we can effectively and efficiently resolve world problems with computational graphics and AI.
